[Renting or Returning a Bike?](https://team-a2c2e.github.io/Project-One/)

<!-- Purpose of Application -->

## PURPOSE

Our application helps users to locate nearby bike stations in their local area.

Whether a user wishes to rent or return a bike, there has never before been a more streamlined method to find and navigate to a station that will contain the amount of needed bikes or empty slots.

This will, in turn, aid in reducing emissions in metropolitan areas across the globe.

<!-- Our Experience -->

## OUR EXPERIENCE

Challenges: <br> We had some difficulty using the API to give us usable data <br> Timing issues with page loading when fetching API and working through Promises <br> HREF on button clicks gave issues when clicking wouldn't load page.

Successes: <br> We have become experts at using a for loop and a For Each Loop <br> Successfully created navigation buttons that use LAT LONG of the user to map from them to the station <br> Mobile Friendly

## FEATURES INCLUDE

Save Station to Favorite <br> Getting User Location <br> Navigation using Google Maps <br> Sorting stations based off User Location <br>
